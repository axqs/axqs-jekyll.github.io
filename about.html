	<p>Q Smart is an amateur photographer who's interest in photography emerged around 2014 when Q and her family took a trip to London and her father bought her a disposable film camera for the trip. Since then, she has dabbled in sports photography with her high school golf team, concert photography with the <a class="inline" href="https://www.facebook.com/guphotosoc" target="_blank">Glasgow University Photography Society</a>, and many location portrait shoots with her brother and many of her friends. Some of her favorite places to shoot are at Point Dume, Yosemite National Park, Death Vallley National Park, and the streets of Glasgow, New York City, and Los Angeles. She is self-taught and has always jumped on any opportunity to imporve her skill and expand her knowledge in the field.</p>
	<p>She is a third year student at the <a class="inline" href="https://www.gla.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Glasgow</a>, pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Computing Science.</p>
